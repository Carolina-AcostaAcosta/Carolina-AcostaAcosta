ðŸ«¡ I'm currently studying the Computer Engineering Degree at Universidad de La Laguna. Almost done, though!

I'm always looking for things to do, and every project you can find I'll be there ðŸ˜…

I'm a full on nerd who loves to watch series, reading and bake all kinds of desserts. ðŸ˜‹

# How to reach me

You can find me in almost all social media under the username @carol_0609, except Twitter/X which is @Kroll_0609. Yes, my birthday is September 6th. Yes, I was dying of creativity the day I decided my username.

(My pronouns are she/her, by the way!)

# FUN FACT ðŸ¤ª

I'm a swiftie, so I probably will always find ways to bring Taylor Swift to the conversation. I mean, how could you not? /k
